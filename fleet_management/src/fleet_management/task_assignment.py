        Task 8 — implementation steps:
            1. Loop until all tasks in self.task_management.task_list are
               assigned:
                   while any(not t['task_assigned']

                                  if a.agent_state == "IDLE"]
            3. Find unassigned tasks:
                   unassigned = [t for t in self.task_management.task_list
                                 if not t['task_assigned']]

                   a. Pop the first unassigned task.
                   b. Set task['task_assigned'] = True

                   d. Set agent.agent_state     = "EXECUTING"
                   e. Set agent.current_task    = task
            5. (Optional) Select the *best* agent per task — e.g. the idle
               agent whose current_node is geographically closest to the
               task's startNodeId.
               Use self.graph.nodes[node_id]['pos'] for coordinates.
            6. Sleep briefly before the next check to avoid busy-waiting:
                   time.sleep(0.5)
